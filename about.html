            <h1>About us</h1>
            <P class="text-start">Finding the red rose in the mailbox was a pleasant surprise for Sarah. She didn't have
                a boyfriend or know of anyone who was interested in her as anything more than a friend. There wasn't
                even a note attached to it. Although it was a complete mystery, it still made her heart jump and race a
                little more than usual. She wished that she could simply accept the gesture and be content knowing
                someone had given it to her, but that wasn't the way Sarah did things. Now it was time to do a little
                detective work and try to figure who had actually left the red rose.
                It was easy to spot her. All you needed to do was look at her socks. They were never a matching pair.
                One would be green while the other would be blue. One would reach her knee while the other barely
                touched her ankle. Every other part of her was perfect, but never the socks. They were her micro act of
                rebellion.
                Trees. It was something about the trees. The way they swayed with the wind in unison. The way they
                shaded the area around them. The sounds of their leaves in the wind and the creaks from the branches as
                they sway, The trees were making a statement that I just couldn't understand.</P>
            <P class="text-start">It wasn't supposed to end that way. The plan had been meticulously thought out and
                practiced again and again. There was only one possible result once it had been implemented, but as they
                stood there the result wasn't anything close to what it should have been. They all blankly looked at
                each wondering how this could have happened. In their minds, they all began to blame the other members
                of the group as to why they had failed.
                Twenty-five stars were neatly placed on the piece of paper. There was room for five more stars but they
                would be difficult ones to earn. It had taken years to earn the first twenty-five, and they were
                considered the "easy" ones.
